# Project Movies (made by Helena Wiklund and Julia Nikitina as a pair programming project)

This multi-page React application "Movies site" was made as a Week 12 project for Technigo bootcamp using React Router and useState, useEffect, useParams hooks.
The aim of this project was to build a movie app that displays the latest movies and details when you click on them using React and The Movie Database API.

## The problem

We reached all stretch goals for this week (blue, red and black levels) and we learned A LOT. The most important thing is that we got a chance to train on how to pass information such as movie ids in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content. Trying to achieve the last stretch goal, we got stucked by not passing exact param to the Route to exactly match a location when rendering Characters component, but it feels like we learned our lesson and really got the good understading of Routes. 
If we had more time, we would try to apply styled components to at least some of our pages, but we are very proud of the work we've done and our third page displaying characters of the movie.
